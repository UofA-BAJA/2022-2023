In order to make commits to the main branch, please get approval from Oliver or Alex first and they will review your code. If approved, your code will be reflected in the main branch of the codebase.

This year we will be mainly writing c++ modules and using these modules to help develop our arduino code, which can easily be transfered over to the upcoming linux based system. Keep in mind that everything will be code reviewed by your peers in order to keep a similar format and organization to our codebase. We also have a Codigna review bot that will automatically grade our code and offer suggestions in order to improve performance or legibility.

If you have any questions regarding any pieces of software or their functionality, please reach out to the officers.
